Hello! Here is a small guide to how to use this application.

Please note that the intended audience for use is the blind, and this
application is still very much a WIP.

The application is designed to notify the user audibly every thirty
seconds, saying out loud the time since the application was opened.

The application will run for 5 minutes and 45 seconds, after which it
will automatically close.

The timer can be paused at any moment by pressing the spacebar key
on your keyboard once, and can be resumed by pressing the spacebar key again

The application is not capable of anything else. This includes increasing
the length of the timer, rewinding the timer, etc. These features may be
included in future builds.

Other than that, enjoy!
